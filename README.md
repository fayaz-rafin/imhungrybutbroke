## ImHungryButBroke
##Version 1.0.24
As university students, paying for tuition is very expensive and we have a very tight budget for our living. As such, we always have to constantly check how much money we spend on food. Well we no longer have to do that thanks to our web-app called "I'mHungrybutBroke"!
## What it does
Let's say we have a specific budget in mind (20 dollar budget) for food. Our app lets you find the cheapest food from the nearest food vendors and redirects you to their app or website to order food.
## How we built it
We used React, node.js and Material-ui to build this web-app
## Challenges we ran into
For some of us, this was the first time we used react, so it was a big learning process. We ran into was styling the website as we used material-ui for the first time on a website combined with React which is very different from css.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of bringing our idea to life within 36 hours of the hackathon and for some of us, it was our first time in web development. 
## What we learned
We're proud of learning how to use react in such a short amount of time and understood concepts such as props, hooks and components etc.
## What's next for ImHungryButBroke
We will improve on the UI component of our app by making it look prettier in future iterations and update the way we handle our backend by using a database such as MongoDB which works great with React and node.js.
